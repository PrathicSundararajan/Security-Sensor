# Security-Sensor

The goal of the project is to make a home made and cheap security systems using an ultrasonic sensor. The scripts in this repo cover both the arduino aspects as well as the python scripts that are used to recieve the data. This project was also submitted for the Instructables Battery Powered Contest. 

## Programs Used

- Arduino IDE - Microcontroller used to collect data 
- Python - Used to collect data from the arduino and alert you if the sensor is triggered
